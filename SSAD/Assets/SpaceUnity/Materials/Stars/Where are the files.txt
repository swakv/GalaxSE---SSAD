Notice: "Stars" have been replaced by "Static Stars".
See the version history in the manual: SpaceUnity/_Documentation

It's recommended that you recreate the Static Stars using the
Window  > Space Scene Construction Kit > editor and only having
the "Static Stars" checkbox enabled to recreate stars.

Alternatively you could import the textures from an older version
of SPACE for Unity or your project.
