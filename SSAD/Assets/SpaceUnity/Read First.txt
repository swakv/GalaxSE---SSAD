Thank You for purchasing "SPACE for Unity" (Version 1.5)

Please refer to the documentation found in SpaceUnity/_Documentation to begin
creating space scenes.

QUICKSTART:

1. Load the template scene: SpaceUnity/_Scenes/Template
2. Go to Window | Space Scene Construcition Kit
3. Click "Create Space Scene Prefab"



*** WHAT'S NEW? ***

VERSION 1.5

  * Requires Unity 2017.2 or newer

  * Added SU_TravelWarp script and shader (see Manual for details)
    Fast warping with visual effect and object relative movement.

  * "Static Stars" replaces "Stars" (see Manual for details)
    Saves 185MB in size, reduces draw calls from 6 to 1 (or 2) and
    allows more color customization.
    Note: Old scenes will be missing stars since the textures have
    been removed. You will need to recreate them using Static Stars
    (via the Space Scene Construction Kit editor extension window)
    or you need to import the old textures and materials from a
    previous version of your project or SPACE for Unity.

  * New asteroid fading method
    Handled by GPU for much better performance. Better visually since
    asteroids are scaled instead of transparency faded which looked
    odd against light backgrounds. The performance is greatly increased
    so it should be possible to have more asteroids than before.
    The upper limit of AsteroidFields was increased from 3000 to 10000.

  * Added 211 new nebula textures

  * Added subfolder support to Nebulas, Planets, and Galaxies

  * New asteroid materials
    More specular reflections and added support in the shader for the
    scaling effect.

  * Demo scenes updated
    Old stars were replaced with Static Stars in demo scenes.
    Spaceship now has warp speed effect (press Space and Right Shift).

  * Added Orbit alternative to CameraFollow script.

  * Updated the atmosphere shaders and mesh.

VERSION 1.07

  * Verified in Unity 2017.2 - no changes

  * Removed Unity 3.x and 5.0.x support

  * Updated URL

VERSION 1.06

  * Updated to Unity 5.5 and removed deprecated code.

VERSION 1.05

  * Only Unity 5.x supported.

 FIXES

  * Compiled for Unity 5.x

  * Added pragma "keepalpha" for planet ring shader to allow transparency in Unity 5

  * Removed compiler specific code for Unity version 3.x and 5.x

  * Added interpolation to spaceship rigidbody and changed camera update mode to 
    LATE_UPDATE for smoother movement

VERSION 1.03

 FIXES
 
  * Removed rewrote deprecated 4.x code in scripts 
  
  * Added compile dependent code to ensure Unity 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 executes code
  
  * Fixed problem with asteroids not being created after build if "fading" was enabled
      (Added new shader SpaceUnity/AsteroidTransparent located in a Resources folder to 
      ensure it is always included during the build process)
      
  * Fixed flickering of atmospheres in Unity 4.1 and above
      Fixed by changing point lights distance from 100000 to 20000 (precision issue)
      
  * Fixed memory leak of explosions never being removed
      Added SU_Explosion.cs script that destroys gameobject after delay

VERSION 1.02
  
 FIXES

 * Changed name to SPACE for Unity due to Unity Asset Store policy conflict.

 * Prefixed all scripts with “SU_” to avoid naming conflicts.

 * Prefab: SpaceUnity/Prefabs/SpaceSceneElements/LocalStar<Large/Medium/Small>
     Flickering Planets in Unity 4
       Changed Range of child Point light from 1E+10 to 100000 because it made
       the planet textures flicker in Unity v4. (Unity 3.5 supported “Infinity”
       for point lights which didn’t work in 4.0 and apparently too high of a
       range causes flickering, presumably due to some floating point issues.)
       Note: If you have created Local Stars in your scene with broken prefab
       connection you will need to set these values manually as well on scenes
       you created.

     Missing white star disc after disappearing out of view in Unity 4
       The white star disc disappeared in Unity v4 after the local star had
       once been out of view. This was not the case in v3.5. On child
       ParticleSystem-Disc, changed Duration and Lifetime from Infinity to 100
       and set particle system to looping to looping which keeps the disc
       visible at all times.

 * Script: SU_SpaceSceneSwitcher.cs
    Added compiler version verification to use SetActive instead of deprecated
    command SetActiveRecursively in Unity v4

 * Scene: "Demo - Planet Climates"
    Enabled gameObjects MeshEngines and MeshSpaceship that were accidentally
    disabled before.
   
 * Planet Material: "Planet-Desert-OrangeWithImpacts"
    Added missing label "atmosphere-brown-medium" because planets of this type
    didn't receive an atmosphere when created due to the missing label on the 
    asset.

 * Scene: "Demo - Colorized Red" 
    Set background stars (which was missing) texture for SpaceScene camera.

 * Prefabs: _Demo/Prefabs/SpaceScene1 & SpaceScene2
    Added background stars (which was missing) in SpaceScene1.
    Replaced local stars which were not rendering prominence and cascades.

VERSION 1.01 

 First public release.
